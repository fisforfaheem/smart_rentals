# Project Knowledge Base

## Project Overview
Car rental application with user and driver roles, built with Flutter and Firebase.

## Key Decisions
1. Using GetX for:
   - State management
   - Dependency injection
   - Navigation
   - Reason: Simplifies development and reduces boilerplate

2. Firebase Integration:
   - Real-time database for live updates
   - Firebase Auth for authentication
   - Reason: Scalable and reliable backend solution

3. Modular Architecture:
   - Feature-first organization
   - Independent modules
   - Reason: Better maintainability and scalability

## Lessons Learned
1. Code Organization
   - Keep related code together in modules
   - Use proper file naming conventions
   - Document complex logic

2. State Management
   - Use GetX controllers effectively
   - Keep state close to where it's used
   - Avoid global state when possible

3. Firebase Best Practices
   - Proper security rules
   - Efficient data structure
   - Minimize database reads

4. UI/UX Considerations
   - Consistent design language
   - Responsive layouts
   - User feedback for actions

## Common Issues and Solutions
1. Authentication
   - Issue: Session management
